Hello there!      
See, my current profile @TheGr8Coder has (or atleast had) many, many static websites and/or other things which were of low effort (because my 11/12 yo self made them in the little free time I used to get). These weren't good at all and as of writing this, were abandoned for a long time and were taking up space in my GitHub account. Moreover, I am trying to improve myself and now think that I should separate these projects from my main profile, because these projects served no use at all. Hence, this organisation was made. This serves as a place where I can transfer my low-skill or no-effort projects. Instead of deleting or making these projects private, I feel that I should embrace these projects as these were the projects that have helped me to learn programming. I am fully transparent about my projects and hence never want to or will hide my projects. I have decided to even keep those projects up, in which I have plagiarised a little or copied someone's work. In those projects, I have now (or will soon) mentioned the creator and if in case the aforementioned creator wants me to take down my projects, I will do so immediately.     
So, these projects will not be worked upon further.
